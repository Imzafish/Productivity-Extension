### New Tab Productivity Chrome Web Extension 

Focus Frame is a simple minimalistic chrome extension It has a simple clock, a todo list and a link .

This project was inspired by [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca). This is a side project just for learning web stuff and most code was written by other more talented people. Will most likely add wallpapers overtime and chnange the icon.

# Example
